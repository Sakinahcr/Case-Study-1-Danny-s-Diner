## Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite

## Questions and Solutions

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**
```sql
SELECT 
    s.customer_id, SUM(n.price) AS total_spent
FROM
    sales s
        JOIN
    menu n ON s.product_id = n.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
```
**Steps**
- To find the total spent by the customers, I **SUM** the ```price``` of the product from the ```menu```.
- To breakdown the total spent by each customer, I  **JOIN** ```menu``` and ```sales```  which contains the ```customer_id```
  
**Findings**

_Customer A spent the most while Customer C spent the least with $76 and $36 respectively_

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT (order_date)) AS days_visited
FROM
    sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY days_visited DESC;
```
**Steps**
- To find the number of days visited, I **COUNT(DISTINCT)** the ```order_date``` from the ```sales``` table.
- To breakdown the days into each customer, I **GROUP BY** the count by ```customer_id```.

**Findings**

_Customer B is the most frequent to the diner with total of 6 days compared to Customer A and C with 4 and 2 days respectively_

**3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**

```sql
WITH order_rank AS (SELECT 
	s.customer_id, 
	n.product_name, 
	s.order_date, 
	DENSE_RANK () OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS num_rank
FROM 
	sales s
JOIN menu n ON s.product_id = n.product_id)
SELECT 
    customer_id, product_name, order_date
FROM
    order_rank
WHERE
    num_rank = 1
GROUP BY customer_id , product_name , order_date; 
```   
**Steps**
- Create **Common Table Expression (CTE)** to **RANK** the menu purchased based on the ```order_date```.
- Then, use the **WHERE = 1** to retrieve only the order ranked as 1, which are the earliest orders.
- **GROUP BY** the ```customer_id``` to group the result based on customers. 

**Findings**

- _Sushi and Curry were the first items purchased by Customer A_
- _Customer B bought curry while Customer C bought ramen as their first purchase_

**4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**
```sql
WITH most_purchased AS 
(SELECT 
    s.product_id,
    n.product_name,
    COUNT(s.order_date) AS count_of_purchase
FROM
    sales s
        JOIN
    menu n ON s.product_id = n.product_id
GROUP BY product_id , product_name
ORDER BY count_of_purchase DESC
LIMIT 1)
SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    p.product_name,
    COUNT(s.order_date) AS number_of_purchase
FROM
    sales s
        JOIN
    most_purchased p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id , p.product_name; 
```

**Steps**
- Create **CTE** to find the product which mostly purchased by the customer by uing **COUNT** function and **ORDER** the count in **DESC** order
- Create 2nd query to breakdown how many times each customers bought the most popular product

**Findings**

_The most purchased item is Ramen which mostly purchased by Customer A and Customer C_

**5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?**

```sql
WITH most_popular AS (
SELECT 
	s.customer_id, 
	n.product_name, 
	count(order_date) AS order_count,
	DENSE_RANK () OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY count(order_date) DESC) AS order_rank
FROM 
	sales s
JOIN 
	menu n ON s.product_id = n.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id, product_name)
SELECT 
    customer_id, product_name, order_count
FROM
    most_popular
WHERE
    order_rank = 1;
```
**Steps**

- Create **CTE** to **RANK** the ```product_name``` by the frequency of the ```order_date```.
- Create outer query to extract only the ```product_name``` mostly bought by customer by using condition **WHERE**
 the rank = 1.

**Findings**

 _Overall, ramen is the most popular menu among the customers_

**6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**

```sql
WITH purchase_after_membership AS (
SELECT 
	m.customer_id, 
    s.product_id, 
    DENSE_RANK () OVER (PARTITION BY m.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date) AS order_rank
FROM 
	members m
JOIN 
	sales s ON m.customer_id = s.customer_id AND s.order_date > m.join_date)
SELECT 
    p.customer_id, n.product_name
FROM
    purchase_after_membership p
        JOIN
    menu n ON p.product_id = n.product_id
WHERE
    order_rank = 1
ORDER BY customer_id;
```

**Steps**
- Create **CTE** to find the first product purchased by customer after being a member. **RANK** the product by the ```order_date``` with condition the ```order_date``` is after the ```join_date``` after being a member.
- Outer query to extract only the product ranked first; which the first ```product_name``` purchased after being a member. 

**Findings**

_After being a member, Customer A bought ramen while Customer B bought sushi. FYI, only Customer A & B subscribe the membership of the diner._

**7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**

```sql
WITH purchase_after_membership AS (
SELECT 
	m.customer_id, 
    s.product_id, 
    DENSE_RANK () OVER (PARTITION BY m.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date DESC) AS order_rank
FROM 
	members m
JOIN 
	sales s ON m.customer_id = s.customer_id
AND s.order_date < m.join_date)
SELECT 
    p.customer_id, n.product_name
FROM
    purchase_after_membership p
        JOIN
    menu n ON p.product_id = n.product_id
WHERE
    order_rank = 1
ORDER BY customer_id;
```

**Steps**

- Create **CTE** to find the last product purchased by customer before being a member. **RANK** the product by the ```order_date``` in **DESC** order with condition the ```order_date``` is before the ```join_date``` being a member.
- Outer query to extract only the product ranked first; which the last ```product_name``` purchased before being a member.
  
**Findings**

_Customer A purchased Sushi and Curry while Customer B bought Sushi before subscribe to the membership._


**8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**

```sql
SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    COUNT(n.product_name) AS total_item,
    SUM(n.price) AS amount_spent
FROM
    sales s
        JOIN
    menu n ON s.product_id = n.product_id
        JOIN
    members m ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
        AND s.order_date < m.join_date
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
```
**Steps**
- Use **COUNT** on ```product_name``` to find the total items and **SUM** on ```price``` to total the amount spent.
- Use **JOIN** to combine all the information which are from different tables; ```sales```, ```menu``` and ```members```.
- **GROUP** the results by the customer_id.

**Findings**

- _Before being a member, Customer A spent on 2 items, total of $25._
- _Customer B spent on 3 items, which total to $45 before being a member._
  
**9.  If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?**

```sql
WITH points AS(SELECT 
    n.product_id,
    CASE
        WHEN n.product_name <> 'sushi' THEN n.price * 10
        ELSE 2 * (n.price * 10)
    END AS customer_points
FROM
    menu n)
SELECT 
    s.customer_id, SUM(p.customer_points) AS points_collected
FROM
    sales s
        JOIN
    points p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id;
```
**Steps**

**Findings**

**10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?**


```sql
WITH customer_point AS
(SELECT 
    m.customer_id,
    s.order_date,
    m.join_date,
    CASE
        WHEN n.product_name = 'sushi' THEN n.price * 20
        WHEN s.order_date BETWEEN m.join_date AND DATE(join_date + 6) THEN n.price * 20
        ELSE n.price * 10
    END AS points
FROM
    sales s
        JOIN
    members m ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
        JOIN
    menu n ON s.product_id = n.product_id)
SELECT 
    customer_id, SUM(points) AS points_collected
FROM
    customer_point
